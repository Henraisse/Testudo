TODO: 

Simulate unit position lag in order to get more... realistic unit movements (along with tuning all parameters)
Simulate Units further: unit direction, unit speed (walking, running, marching), etc
Simulate Unit combat: unit direction, weapons, armor, damaged limbs, stamina, skill, shield direction, etc

Simulate internal formations:
- Archers in the back
- pikes/spears/swords in front
- shields at the edges
- elite soldiers around the commander
- rookies in front
- experienced troops at the edges

Simulate wounded: units backing off into the formation

Add functions:
- charge (units break formation and charge the opposing side
- double envelopment (unit at the flanks break formation and charge the opposing sides)
- special formations:
	- testudo (square formation, moving slowly, shielded against missiles, requires large shield-bearing units)
	- phalanx (square formation, all units aligned in the exact same direction)
	- formation shitpile (All units arbitrarily bunched up)
	- shield wall (Y'all watch(ed) Vikings, right?)
	- hollow square
	- hollow circle
	- double columns with given width
	- escort formations
- vanguard: units in front to screen advance

- reformation algorithm: Allow realistic change of formations, instead of rigid and unnatural movements (every soldier wants to move as little as possible, right?)
